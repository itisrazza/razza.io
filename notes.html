    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>Here are some notes I've written down for different things. Think of them as a bunch of Markdown files left in a folder somewhere.</p>
    <p class="callout callout-info">A bit of a heads up. I'm currently migrating my notes over from Notion. They might be broken here and there, but most important parts should be here ready to go.</p>
