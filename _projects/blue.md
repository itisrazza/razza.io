Blue is small runtime with the goal of adding modulal functionality to
applications and embedded devices.

The goal is to be as easy to integrate as [Lua](https://www.lua.org), but have
smaller module binaries and lower memory usage by having the executable modules
be stored as bytecode instead of ASCII text.

This project was envisioned for two potential use-cases:

* An e-Ink tablet to be used for board or TCG game sessions.

The project is named after [an energy drink](https://v-energy-drink.com/products/blue).
