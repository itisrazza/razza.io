This website is an amalgamation of HTML, CSS and Markdown files which gets assembled by [Jekyll] and then hosted on [GitHub Pages]. This page acts as the colophon.

It has a few sections:

* **[Projects]** - links to things I've worked on over the years
* **[Notes]** - brain dumps of things I keep forgetting (and scraps from old blogs)
* **[Links]** - to other people's sites I find interesting

I'm not a big fan of posting too much of myself on the open web these days, but there will be a few other things added to this site and I find some more free time.

I will end up closing the repo one of these days, but after I factor out the CSS styling and GitHub Actions workflows into their own repos.
