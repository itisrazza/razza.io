This website is an amalgamation of HTML, CSS and Markdown files which gets assembled by [Jekyll] and then hosted on [GitHub Pages]. This page acts as the colophon.

It has a few sections:

* **[Projects]** - links to things I've worked on over the years
* **[Notes]** - brain dumps of things I keep forgetting (and scraps from old blogs)
* **[Links]** - to other people's sites I find interesting

I'm not a big fan of posting too much of myself on the open web these days, but there will be a few other things added to this site and I find some more free time.

[Notes]: /notes

Source code readers. Here's some links for you:

* current Jekyll-powered version lives in [`main`][main] (surprise!)
* previous React version (2020-2022) lives in [`2022`][2022]

[main]: https://github.com/itisrazza/razza.io/tree/main
[2022]: https://github.com/itisrazza/razza.io/tree/2022

You might see branches pop up and disappear whenever I do major upgrades or design refreshes (like this one used to live in a branch called `refresh` before it got merged).
