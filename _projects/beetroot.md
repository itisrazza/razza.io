> Beetroot is currently in development.

Beetroot solves the question of "who's on AUX?" whenever someone asks to queue a song. It is similar to [SharePlay] and [Spotify Jams], but allows music from multiple sources to be queued.

[SharePlay]: https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/iphone/iphb657eb791/ios
[Spotify Jams]: https://support.spotify.com/us/article/jam

I'm looking at implementing the following sources:

* **Local Media Playback** - like your own collection of MP3s, for example
* **[Spotify]**
* **[Apple Music]ยน**
* **[SoundCloud]**

[Spotify]: https://spotify.com/
[Apple Music]: https://music.apple.com/
[SoundCloud]: https://soundcloud.com/

ยน Only on platforms where [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/musickit) is available

At launch, Beetroot will be released for:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux (Flatpak)
