<div class="callout callout-info"><b>Update:</b> VGAPainter is planned to be revived and updated in the near future.</div>

VGAPainter is a 256-color bitmap editor primarily targeting VGA mode 13h. It also supports custom palletes, importing and exporting to true colour formats and a binary bitmap format.

This was created as an experiment and means of generating visuals capable of display in MS-DOS. But it can also be used in making pixel art for other systems as well.
