My name is Rare»ô&nbsp;Nistor[^1], I also go by Razza. I'm a
software&nbsp;developer based in Wellington, New&nbsp;Zealand.

[^1]: pronounced "Raresh".

Career-wise, I've been working as a software developer within the energy retail
space for over 3 years. Most of it has been on Ruby on Rails.

Outside of work, I enjoy working on my own projects and learning new things.
Most of them are tools I use to solve problems I encounter[^2] and to learn about
new ways of achieving them[^3].

[^2]: [SuperSize](projects/supersize) and [Beetroot](projects/beetroot) are a
      few examples

[^3]: some of them are on [the archived project list](projects#archived)

Beyond software development, I enjoy building gadgets and learning electronics
and building gadgets[^4]. Some of better projects I make will likely end up on
the website at some point.

P.S. if you're interested in the how this site is built, see
