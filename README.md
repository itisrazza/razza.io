# razza.io

This is the content for my website which gets deployed to GitHub Pages and makes its way to [razza.io](https://razza.io/).

This is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is currently in development.

## Build the site

Make sure you have Jekyll and Node.js installed and run:

```
npm run serve
```

It can be built proper with:

```
npm run build
```
