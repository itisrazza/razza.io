A new note in a while, eh? New Zealand has gone into lockdown and I suddenly had a lot of free time on my hands. So I set up a Minecraft server on my home server and after playing with my friends and having that server moved over to a friend's who has way more powerful metal to carry it, I though I might as well install Windows Server on it to provide some extra services I couldn't get working on Linux, like WDS.

That venture ended in failure with Windows failing to activate as another one of my friends reprimanded me for trying such a thing.

So here I am, running back to good old trusty Debian Linux.

# Debian Install and Config

The first thing to do is to say *arrivederci* to Windows Server and reinstall Debian. Luckily Debian 11 was released last weekend, which means I've got something in exchange for my boneheadedness. Luckily I already had a backup with all the data from before I tried to install Windows and will be restoring that.

The computer running this is an older desktop computer for the early Windows 8 era with the DVD drive swapped out with a 4TB hard drive. Connected to it, I have an external 4TB hard drive to act as a copy of the internal one. Its primary role is to host both SMB and SFTP shares me and my brother can access from within our home.

After installing Debian, I then installed an SSH server and exFAT driver to read my backup drive. I plan on using exFAT for my backups so I can remove the hard drive from the server, I can read it in any machine, be it Windows or Linux.

I've also set up a static IP within my home network so I can easily access it from other machines without having the IP address keep changing. I'll write down the config for future reference:

- `/etc/network/interfaces`
    
    ```
    This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
    
    source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
    
    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    # The primary network interface
    allow-hotplug enp2s0
    iface enp2s0 inet static
    	address	192.168.1.XXX
    	submask	255.255.255.0
    	gateway	192.168.1.1
    	dns-nameservers	192.168.1.1	1.1.1.1	1.0.0.1
    
    # This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface
    iface enp2s0 inet6 auto
    ```
    

I then started to copy the files back to the internal hard drive.

# Users and Shares Setup

The next item on the list is to set up users and shares. I created UNIX users for both me and my brother, accompanied by a folder on the external storage to act as out shares. I've also created a `public` share for movies, music, software etc.

```
/stor1/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shares
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ razz
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vlad
```

These folders would be exposed directly as SMB shares, with symlinks in our own home folders to easily access them thought SFTP.

SFTP is easy enough to get working with SSH.

## Samba

# Backups

Where there are files, there are backups. I plan on having a two levels of backups of the internal hard drive. Nightly backups to the external hard drive (on-site backup), and in the future, weekly off-site backups.

Since I want my external hard drive to be easily accessible during an emergency. I have set it up as a exFAT file system so that it's readable on Windows, macOS and Linux (with the appropriate drivers installed).

Onto the *how*. A program called `rsync` is very useful for making both local and remote copies of everything. I also found an app called [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) for real-time notifications so I have a notification ready in the morning with how the backup went over the weekend. Here's a screenshot from before I reset my server.

## `rsync` and Logs

I'll begin by setting up rsync itself. It'll be set up to archive everything, and keep any deleted files. The future off-site backup will be managed by having an identical copy of the on-site one, file deletions and all.

- **Command explainer:**
    - Local backup (`/stor1` ‚Üí `/stor2`)
        
        The `rsync` archive flag (`-a`) does the following things:
        
        - `-r` - Recursive
        - `-l` - Copy symlinks as symlinks
        - `-p` - Preserve permissions
        - `-t` - Preserve times
        - `-g` - Preserve group
        - `-o` - Preserve owner
        - `-D` - Preserve device and special files
    - Local backup (to exFAT)
        
        ```
        $ rsync -rltv /stor1/ /stor2
        ```
        
        After some testing, the `-a` flag tries to set permissions on the exFAT and fails since exFAT doesn't support UNIX permissions, owner and group rights. To patch this, I've replaced the `-a` flag with a subset of flags it bundles. Namely `-rlt` (recursive, copy symlinks as symlinks and preserve times).
        
    - Remote backup
        
        <aside>
        üöß Coming soon...
        
        </aside>
        
    
    Another tidbit to note with the `rsync` command. A trailing slash at the end of a folder path means to copy the files inside it to the target, not the folder itself. It's (almost) the same as writing `path/to/folder/*` for `cp`.
    

Within the backup script, the output of the `rsync` command will be redirected to `local-rsync.log` and `local-rsync-error.log` to be examined later.

## Notifications

Within the script, I've added some helper functions to help with logging and notifications. I've made a `send` function to do the heavy-lifting of logging and sending the message to Pushover, and `silent`, `success` and `fatal` to act as syntactic sugar for `send` (sets the title and sound relevant for the situation).

Pushover has a nice API where I can send notifications with a simple `curl` command.

```bash
# send out to pushover
curl -X POST \
        -d "token=$PUSHOVER_TOKEN" \
        -d "user=$PUSHOVER_USER" \
        -d "title=$title" \    
        -d "message=$content" \
        -d "sound=$sound" \
        "https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json" \
        >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```

This will let me know how the backups are progressing without pulling up a SSH window. And if something goes wrong I can fix it.

## Scheduling

To make this script run nightly, I'll be using a program standard on many UNIX system called `cron`. Think of it as the Linux version of [Windows's Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler).

I can edit my `crontab` (a fancy name for the list of scheduled tasks) by running `crontab -e`. But since the backup tool copies data from multiple users, I will run it as the `root` user with `sudo`.

Now, because I keep forgetting how to write out the task definitions, I use a website called [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate those for me. 

A line in this file is a different task, first the time it would take place, then the command to run. To run my backup utility at 2AM daily, I'd write this down.

```bash
0 2 * * * /home/backup/backup.sh
```

## Monitoring the Backup

To monitor the backup real-time, the `tail -f` command can be used on the logs to see what `rsync` is up to.

To help with keeping track of how backups are progressing, the script also writes dates into `.running` (to indicate a backup is currently being made), `.failed` with the last attempt ending in failure and `.last` with the last successful backup.

# Web Interface

I've also created a simple web interface for keeping tabs on the server with simple details like the system's uptime, memory usage, access to the "public" share, and the state of the backup.
